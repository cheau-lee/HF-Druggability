# The Druggability Analysis of Heart Failure: Unveiling Therapeutic Targets and Drug Repurposing Opportunities

Welcome to the repository for my MSc thesis! This project presents a comprehensive approach that integrates genetic evidence, bioinformatics tools, and machine learning to identify novel drug targets and repurposing opportunities for heart failure (HF) treatment.

### Key Focus Areas:

- **Gene Prioritisation**: To identify key genes associated with HF by leveraging data from the largest multi-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis of HF to date, and perform MAGMA gene-set analysis to pinpoint genes with significant associations (FDR <0.05).
- **Druggability Assessment**: To evaluate and prioritise these identified genes based on their potential as viable drug targets using DrugnomeAI (>0.80), focusing on features that predict druggability.
- **Unsupervised Machine Learning**: To apply advanced clustering techniques like K-means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical clustering for grouping genes into clusters with high therapeutic relevance and druggability potential.
- **Pathway and Network Analysis**: To analyse protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks using tools like STRING and NetworkX to uncover the roles of key genes in HF pathways.
- **Gene Enrichment Analysis**: To perform enrichment analysis using Reactome, KEGG, Gene Ontology (GO), and ClinVar databases, identifying enriched pathways and biological processes that are crucial in the context of HF.
- **Drug Repurposing**: To identify potential drug repurposing candidates by analysing drug-gene interactions using DGIdb (Drug-Gene Interaction Database) and SIDER (Side Effect Resource), aiming to discover existing drugs that could be repurposed to treat HF.
